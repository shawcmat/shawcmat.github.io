                <h2>The Impacts of Landlessness</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The adverse effects of climate change are likely to harm food supplies and agricultural livelihoods worldwide. 
                    Faced with challenges resulting from increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, some farmers might be forced
                    abandon their occupation. A dramatic increase in landless population could result in increased levels of social 
                    and political conflict. After analyzing agriculture and precipitation data from a large number of countries worldwide, 
                    we found that drier than average growing season weather is associated with declining landownership rates. 
                    For every consecutive dry growing season before a land ownership survey, the agricultural land ownership rate of the affected reigon 
                    falls by 2.51%. This article is an attempt to describe the process behind that analysis.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <h2> The Data</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Any model is only as good as the data it uses. For this project, we there were several key variables we 
                    needed to know. These are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A large, multi-year, multi-country sample of land-ownership data, hopefully at a sub-national resolution.</li>
                        <li>An exogenous way to measure environmental stress, anywhere in the world.</li>
                        <li>A measure of the start and end of the growing season, anywhere in the world.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    The first requirement was resolved quite nicely, thanks to the <a href = "https://dhsprogram.com/data/">Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).</a>
                    The DHS is a data collection program administered in many countries around the world, with most questions interested in healthcare access and outcomes.
                    Lucky for us, some of the surveys included a question regarding land ownership. Also, these surveys are statistically representative at a sub-national resolution,
                    and can be accessed for free as a shapefile through a user-friendly geospatial data portal. Perfect! Well, almost perfect. 
                    The survey is not offered in every country, or every year, so there is a lot of temporal and spatial variety that we need to control for.
                    <br><br>
                    The second requirement is quite a bit more difficult.
